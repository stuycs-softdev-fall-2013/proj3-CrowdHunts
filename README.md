Crowdsourced scavenger hunts using Google Maps and geolocation

Users mark locations in the world and provide clues that will help guide other users to that location. With a number of these clues, the server can generate a dynamic hunt, taking difficulty of clues (measured by percentage of users able to find a given location with a given clue) into account. Hopefully this will run on mobile using geolocation.
